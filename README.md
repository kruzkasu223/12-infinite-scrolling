# 12/27-infinite-scrolling

This project is all about creating a seamless infinite scrolling experience for users.

I will use [React](https://reactjs.org/) with [TypeScript](https://www.typescriptlang.org/) and [vite bundler](https://vitejs.dev/). will use this [rawg.io](rawg.io) api for data fetching.
